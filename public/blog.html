      <em>Its been réal Montréal</em>. After nearly 7 years, we've decided to pack up
      and head for less snowy pastures. I always had a rocky relationship with Montreal,
      but I'm incredibly grateful the community that I've grown with there. Like many
      of you, I've already moved cities a few times now, and I am sad to add yet another
      crop of wonderful people who I will miss dearly to my long distance friendship
      list. until next time, I'd like to keep this blog going as an effort to stay
      connected with everyone. I'll try to an effort to stay as a courtesy to everyone!
