      My dads mechanic, Ted, hooked me up with this old Volvo wagon. It was his customers
      car and he (Ted) has been servicing it for the last decade. The good thing about that
      is that they seemed to have taken good care of it. It's got a ton of miles but
      they've done a lot of work on the engine. They also replaced the Turbo (so this
      wagon is zoomin on the freeway), but the bad part is the speedometer doesnt work
      (so I dont know how much im zoomin). The seats are also pretty torn up.

            Simstead's HOMEPAGE</a></strong>: I was searching the Geocities archive (the personal blogging site from
        the 90s) for some inspirition and came across the page of a Norwegian guy named
        Per Ole Simstead. There are some really great photos of his cars and with his
        family.

        The west coast really is the best place to buy a car. Idk if a car this old
        would have survived the winters on the east coast (with all the salt).

    <em>Its been réal Montréal</em>. After nearly 7 years, we've decided to pack up
    and head for less snowy pastures. I always had a rocky relationship with Montreal,
    but I'm incredibly grateful the community that I've grown with there. Like many
    of you, I've already moved cities a few times now, and I am sad to add yet another
    crop of wonderful people who I will miss dearly to my long distance friendship
    list. until next time, I'd like to keep this blog going as an effort to stay
    connected with everyone. I'll try to keep these brief as a courtesy to everyone!
